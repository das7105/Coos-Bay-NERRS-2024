The DischarageConditions_forSedModel.pdf file illustrates the discharge and river suspended-sediment concentrations (SSC) used as an input to the model. See the below-referenced papers for more details.

The other files contain .csv tables and example maps of the following output:

1. Depth-averaged SSC_90thPercentile. These tables contain the 90th percentile of depth-averaged suspended sediment concentrations (g/L) in the model domain from a one-month period in each of three seasons (summer, winter event, and winter - see the time-series plots in the pdf for reference). For summer, this one-month period starts on June 22nd. For the winter and winter event cases, this one-month period starts on Jannuary 10th. 

2. Taub_hrshighstress. These tables contain the number of hours when the bed shear velocity exceeds 1 cm/s, which is commonly used as a nominal threshold of motion for sand. It should be noted that bed shear velocity is simply bed shear stress which has been re-dimensionalized according to the fluid density to yield units of m/s. This calculation was made for the same one-month period used for the depth-averaged SSC values (above), and so the total number of hours in the record is 2880.
