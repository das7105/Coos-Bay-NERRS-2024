# Coos-Bay-NERRS-2024
By examining spatial and temporal temperature and sedimentation patterns in Coos Bay estuary this dataset builds on previous projects. The model expanded by 1) adding water temperature as a dynamic variable and 2) increasing the time period of the simulations, which now include three full years from 2014-2016.

This document provides detailed information about three datasets that were generated through a 2021- 2024 collaborative research project titled Buried or Fried? Understanding Sedimentation and Temperature Effects on Native Species in the South Slough Reserve and Coos Estuary, Oregon.  This document also provides information about the project. The project was supported by the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) Science Collaborative, which is funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All Science Collaborative supported projects that collect new data adhere to federal data sharing and archiving requirements. 

Four related datasets are described in this document, as well as a fifth that describes the model setup:
1. Long sediment cores (>20 cm) collected in Coos Bay estuary, Oregon in 2021
2. Short sediment cores (~15 cm) collected in Coos Bay estuary, Oregon in 2021-2022
3. Modeled temperature values for 2014-2016 in Coos Bay estuary, Oregon
4. Modeled sediment values for 2014-2016 in Coos Bay estuary, Oregon
5. FVCOM model setup, code, and parameter files

Data Access and Archival:
1. The dataset for the long sediment cores (>20 cm) has been archived at National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and can be accessed here: https://data.noaa.gov/onestop/collections/details/75851d98-0141-4e39-9f51-7d52f6eb90ea
2. The dataset for the short sediment cores (~15 cm) has been archived at National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and can be accessed here: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.nodc:0291012
3. Modeled temperature values for 2014-2016 in Coos Bay estuary, averaged over several different time and space intervals (e.g., monthly, weekly, at specific locations, etc.). See the dataset description for specifics of these model outputs. These are in this repository in the Temp and Salinity Model folder.  
4. Modeled sediment variables for 2014-2016 in Coos Bay estuary, including suspended sediment concentrations and time over a certain bottom shear stress (usually indicating possible movement of sand), averaged over several different time and space intervals (e.g., monthly, weekly, at specific locations, etc.). See the dataset description for specifics of these model outputs. These are in this repository in the Sediment Model folder.
5. FVCOM model setup, code, and parameter files are in this repository. 

See the ReadMe files in each folder for more information on each product archived here.
