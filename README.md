# Coos-Bay-NERRS-2024
By examining spatial and temporal temperature and sedimentation patterns in Coos Bay estuary this dataset builds on previous projects. The model expanded by 1) adding water temperature as a dynamic variable and 2) increasing the time period of the simulations, which now include three full years from 2014-2016.
